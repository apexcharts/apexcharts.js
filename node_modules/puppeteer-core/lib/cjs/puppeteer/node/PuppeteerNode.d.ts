 * Extends the main {@link Puppeteer} class with Node specific behaviour for
 * fetching and downloading browsers.
 *
 * If you're using Puppeteer in a Node environment, this is the class you'll get
 * when you run `require('puppeteer')` (or the equivalent ES `import`).
 *
 * @remarks
 * The most common method to use is {@link PuppeteerNode.launch | launch}, which
 * is used to launch and connect to a new browser instance.
 *
 * See {@link Puppeteer | the main Puppeteer class} for methods common to all
 * environments, such as {@link Puppeteer.connect}.
 *
 * @example
 * The following is a typical example of using Puppeteer to drive automation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
 *
 * (async () => {
 *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
 *   const page = await browser.newPage();
 *   await page.goto('https://www.google.com');
 *   // other actions...
 *   await browser.close();
 * })();
 * ```
 *
 * Once you have created a `page` you have access to a large API to interact
 * with the page, navigate, or find certain elements in that page.
 * The {@link Page | `page` documentation} lists all the available methods.

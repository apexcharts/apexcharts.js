## [0.24.0] - 2024-03-17

### Changed
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions

- Removed `package-lock.json` as otherwise yarn complains (`warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.`).
- Dropped support (in tests) for Node.js <=16 as puppeteer also support for these versions

# This workflow will do the following when a pull request is made against the main branch:
# 1. Clone base repository (apexcharts/apexcharts.js), install npm packages, build samples, and then generate e2e snapshots
# 2. Clone head repository (the repository with the code in the pull request), install npm packages, build samples, get snapshots generated from the base repository, run tests, and then generate an apexcharts build
# Test coverage results, base repository snapshots, head repository snapshots and diffs, sample HTML, and the apexcharts build are all uploaded to the workflow artifacts
# The diffs, build, and coverage results get uploaded even if the test fails for manual inspection and to make debugging easier
